# 💘 Be Mine - A Cute Valentine's Day App

This is a fun and interactive **Valentine's Day app** built with **React** that playfully asks the question: **"Will you be my valentine?"** 💖

When the user clicks **"No"**, the "Yes" button gets bigger, making it harder to say no! Eventually, it becomes impossible to resist saying **"Yes!"**—and when they do, they are greeted with a celebratory animation. 🎉

## 🎨 Features
- **Cute & Playful UI** – Includes adorable Valentine's Day graphics 🌹
- **Dynamic Button Resizing** – The "Yes" button grows when "No" is clicked 📏
- **Fun Responses** – Custom text changes on the "No" button 😆
- **Celebratory Ending** – A fun animation when the user accepts! 🎊
- **Background Music** – A romantic audio track plays in the background 🎶
- **Audio Toggle** – Users can mute/unmute the music using an audio button 🎵
